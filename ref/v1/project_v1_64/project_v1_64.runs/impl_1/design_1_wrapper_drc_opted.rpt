Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line434/PE/globalram_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line434/PE/globalram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[8] (net: design_1_i/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line434/PE/counterdata[6]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/myip_0/inst/myip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/nolabel_line434/PE/counterdata_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
